RAM: a roguelike about poking around in memory

RAM MAP

00 = Player appearance.
     top 3 bits = color
     bottom 5 bits is character, counting down from ascii '@'

01-0F = Player name. Zero terminated

10-12 = Monster 1 flags, pos, hp.
13-15 = Monster 2 flags, pos, hp.
16-18 = Monster 3 flags, pos, hp.
19-1B = Monster 4 flags, pos, hp.
1C-1E = Monster 5 flags, pos, hp.
1F = Spell memory (8 bits)

20-23 = identification
24-27 = timers
28-2F = inventory

30 = door appearance
31 = wall appearance
32 = floor color
33 = z delta       (signed)
34 = timer delta   (signed)
35 = damage offset (signed)
36 = ?
37 = ? (should mess things up very hard)

38 = "text sync" (causes glitches when set high)

39 = Player HP (capped by XL).

3A = Player TP (capped by XL).

3B = high nibble: XL 0-15
     low nibble: Def 0-15

3C = position (y + 19*x)

3D = dlvl

3E = metal (hi) acid (lo) res

3F = fire (hi) elec (lo) res


Player:
* name char[15], appearance (3bit color 5bit char + '!')
* HP 0-255 (0 = death)
* SP 0-255
* maxes decided by: XL 1-15 (0 = drained to death)
& Def 0-15
* Dlvl 1-255 (dungon goes scarily deep!! but Amulet on D20)
  (0 = corrupted world: flip 50 random bits then tele to random dlvl)
  (this should lead to certainish death?)
* identification: 4 bytes (= 32 bits, but not all used)
* timers: 4 bytes
  (poison, haste, charge, protect)
* spell memory: 1 byte (= 8 spells)
* aptitudes: 2 bytes (= 4bit signed for each element)
* inventory: 8 items

* text sync: 1 byte (causes text glitches!)

Elements are: METAL, ACID, FIRE, ELEC.

* Position: 0-255
Boards are 19x13. Positions are x+19*y. This means 247-255 are ununsed -- if
the player ends up here she zips through to 0 but one bit is flipped each tile.

Monsters:
Room in memory for 5 monsters: flags, pos, hp. Top 4 bits of flags are monster
type (16 species). Then charged (dam*2), vulnerable (def=0), venomous (poisons)
and corrupted (dam*2 and fucks bits up). Charged and corrupted stack.

melee is 2dXL.

Items:
00 = nothing
01 = crowbar:  XLd(3 + metal) melee
02 = volcanic shard:  XLd(5 + fire) melee
03 = taser:  XLd(6 + elec) stun melee
04 = jelly gun:  XLd(3 + acid) ranged

1D = B-device (copy byte into accumulator)
1E = palantir (see everything)
1F = golden pendant

Dungeon levels:
Blah I guess I can draw 256 small vaults! Generate monsters, items, and
switches (address bits 0-5?)
